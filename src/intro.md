# Introduction

This book is a resource for Rust messaging. It has official slogans and talking
points on a number of topics, ranging from general pitches for Rust to specific
rebuttals of often-raised issues.

The goal for each section is *not* to be comprehensive, but rather to give the
most important messages, concisely.
